# EDUKIT
EdukIt is a smart toolkit that helps students stay organized and connected. Track classes, assignments, and grades in one place, get reminders for deadlines, and collaborate easily with peers and teachers. Accessible anywhere, EdukIt makes learning simpler, engaging, and stress‑free.


 EdukIt 
A smart, modular toolkit designed to simplify student life by unifying academics, communication, and growth into one seamless platform.  


 Inspiration  
Students often juggle multiple apps, reminders, and scattered resources. EdukIt was inspired by the idea of a **single toolkit** that could unify classes, assignments, grades, and collaboration into one place.  



 What it does  
- Tracks classes, assignments, and grades in a clean dashboard  
- Sends reminders for deadlines and exams  
- Enables collaboration with peers and teachers  
- Provides insights into personal progress  
- Works seamlessly on both mobile and web  



How we built it  
- **Frontend:** HTML + CSS for a responsive, dark‑themed UI  
- **Logic:** JavaScript for dynamic interactions and profile management  
- **Storage:** LocalStorage to persist student data across sessions  



 Challenges we ran into  
- Balancing simplicity with functionality in the UI  
- Debugging data persistence and ensuring smooth transitions between profile view and edit mode  
- Handling edge cases like empty fields or missing data  



 Accomplishments we’re proud of  
- Built a working prototype that feels intuitive and student‑friendly  
- Designed a modular layout that can easily be expanded  
- Achieved a responsive design that works across devices  


 What we learned  
- The importance of **user‑centered design** in education tools  
- How modular coding and clean UI/UX design improve scalability  
- How AI can accelerate debugging and refinement  



 AI Assistance  
During development, I used **AI (Microsoft Copilot)** to help debug errors, refine code, and explain complex issues. This allowed me to quickly identify problems in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and improve the project’s structure and readability. AI acted as a collaborative partner, guiding me through troubleshooting and helping me modularize the design.  



What’s next for EdukIt  
- Avatar uploads and theme customization  
- Calendar and productivity app integration  
- Expansion into a full student ecosystem with gamified learning and smart analytics
